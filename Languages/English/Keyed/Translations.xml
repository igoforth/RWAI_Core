    <RWAI_Welcome>Welcome to RimWorldAI!

You've downloaded the mod, now let's get the AI up and running! &quot;Continue&quot; will download the necessary AI files in the background. This might take a little while as the AI, depending on selected size, is between 2 to 8 GB - thanks for your patience!

Once set up, RimWorldAI can run entirely offline. If you disable automatic updates, no internet connection is needed, keeping your AI interactions as private as your colony secrets!

Prefer to check for updates on your own schedule? Simply head to settings to manually check whenever you wish.

Enable automatic updates to effortlessly keep your AI in tip-top shape, ensuring you always have the best and latest features.

Happy storytelling and may your colony thrive!</RWAI_Welcome>
